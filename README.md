1. Duplicate and remix [this BuildShip Workflow](https://buildship.app/remix/b5282209-ece1-4289-aa1f-123b0cd09743). This should create a new workflow named `Dream Interpretation`.

1. Note the endpoint URL. It should look like `https://xy1ab2.buildship.run/api/interpret-dream`

### Setting up the client

1. Clone this repository
1. Go to the project root
1. Copy `env.template` to `.env.local`
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_HOST` to your endpoint host, ex: `https://xy1ab2.buildship.run`
1. Install the client dependencies:
    ```bash
    $ cd <PROJECT-ROOT>
    $ npm install
    ```
